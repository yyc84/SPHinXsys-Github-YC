## Description

SPHinXsys (pronunciation: s'finksis) is an acronym from Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics for industrial compleX systems. 
It provides C++ APIs for physical accurate simulation and aims to model coupled industrial dynamic systems including fluid, solid, multi-body dynamics 
and beyond with SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics), a meshless computational method using particle discretization. 
For more information on the SPHinXsys project, please check the project website: https://www.sphinxsys.org.

SPHinXsys is a multi-physics, multi-resolution SPH library. 
Although it is not a standalone application itself, 
many examples designated for the specific type of applications are provided.

## Examples at a glance

Using SPHinXsys library, straightforward and fast multi-physics modeling can be achieved. 
Here, we present several short examples in flow, solid dynamics, fluid structure interactions (FSI) and dynamic solid contact.
